# Long Range RFID Sniffer
Reads RFID cards from a long/medium distance, and displays the card IDs on a web page on a WiFi network (SSID of a printer by default) created by the device. This is intended to be loaded onto a WiFi-capable Arduino-compatible board and used with a Wiegand long-range reader (like the HID MaxiProx 5375.)
